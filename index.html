    Welcome to My site thats me on the left, RareSneaks a place for sneaker lovers and even those who also don’t know about the culture, here to provide a descriptive insight into some sneaker culture. Allot of companys in business team up to release products to consumers in an effort to boost exposure and to increase the marketing capabilities of their product. Essentially hype, and thats exactly what sneaker companies such as Nike and Adidas do on a large scale.
        The collection that is showcased on this website are collaboration sneakers with the two most infamous sneaker brands; Nike and Adidas.<br/>Nike and Adidas have monopolised and dictated what is considered as “cool” within this niche market; whilst still catering to all other consumers such as professional athlete’s, to physiotherapists and everyday people.
        Businesses like StockX are pioneering in the industry because they offer a dynamic service which allows consumers to directly purchase their favourite sneakers, essentially acting as a middleman between seller and buyer. “The business runs as a live bid/ask marketplace for the most hotly anticipated drops, StockX is a go-to platform for sneakerheads seeking to buy and sell hyped footwear from the likes of OffWhite, Yeezy, Jordan and more.”<br/>
        At RareSneaks we have a gallery of some of our favourite distinctive sneakers which you can view here.
        The gallery includes information and some history about the Nike and adidas’s shown.
